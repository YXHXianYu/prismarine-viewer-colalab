# prismarine-viewer-colalab

> Customized version of the prismarine-viewer for colalab

## 1. Improvements

* Rendering of player skins
  * ![pic1](./README/pic1.png)

## 2. How to use

* Because of my laziness, after `npx webpack`, you need to execute `cp -r ./assets/skins ./public/textures/1.16.4/entity/`
  * You could refer to script `./deploy_on_yxh_machine.fish`
